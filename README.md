**Connect 4 - C/C++ Game**

These files include network implementation of the [Connect4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game.

I used C++ to develop it and some and some concepts about network programming.

This application use TCP/IP communication protocol.

The game can be played by many players at the same time, due to the concurrent TCP/IP server.

Some updates will be added soon.
